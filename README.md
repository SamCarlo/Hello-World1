# Hello-World
The first thing from the tut
I like to learn new things all of the time. Today I want to make something satisfying, like a webpage design. Eventually, I want to build little robots and art installation things like Casey does. I want to learn how to use processing as a physics engine that can be played with and manipulated. I want to write physics lessons that employ that thing. I'm going to be pretty busy soon so maybe these things will take long. I should write a program that prioritizes the lessons and work I do at any given point in time.
